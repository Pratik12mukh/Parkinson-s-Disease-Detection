# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
Detecting Parkinson's disease based on movement patterns can be done using machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques. Here's an example using Python's scikit-learn library:

# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Movement Patterns

This project aims to detect Parkinson's disease based on movement patterns using machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in the file `parkinsons_data.csv`. It contains various features extracted from biomedical voice measurements of individuals, both with and without Parkinson's disease. The dataset can be obtained from [[source link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/parkinsons-disease-data-set)].

## Getting Started

To run the code successfully, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```shell
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
