# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
Detecting Parkinson's disease based on movement patterns can be done using machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques. Here's an example using Python's scikit-learn library:

Open a text editor and create a new file named README.md.
Provide an overview of the project in the README file. Explain that the goal of the project is to detect Parkinson's disease based on movement patterns using machine learning techniques.
Include a brief description of the dataset used and mention where it can be obtained. Provide instructions on how to download or access the dataset.
Explain the steps involved in the code, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions.
Mention the required libraries and dependencies needed to run the code successfully. You can provide instructions on how to install them using pip or conda.
Include any additional instructions or configuration details if necessary.
Add a section for acknowledgments, where you can mention any resources, references, or inspirations you used for the project.
Finally, add your contact information or any other relevant information you want to share.
